										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Person-Centered Therapy</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>WAHEED ALOMARI</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Humanistic therapies evolved in the USA during the 1950s.  <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/carl-rogers.html">Carl Rogers p</a>roposed that therapy could be simpler, warmer and more optimistic than that carried out by behavioral or <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/psychodynamic.html">psychodynamic p</a>sychologists.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">His view differs sharply from the psychodynamic and behavioral approaches in that he suggested that clients would be better helped if they were encouraged to focus on their current subjective understanding rather than on some unconscious motive or someone else&#8217;s interpretation of the situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Rogers strongly believed that in order for a client&#8217;s condition to improve therapists should be warm, genuine and understanding.  The starting point of the Rogerian approach to counseling and psychotherapy is best stated by Rogers (1986) himself:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8216;It is that the individual has within himself or herself vast resources for self-understanding, for altering his or her self-concept, attitudes and self-directed behavior &#8211; and that these resources can be tapped if only a definable climate of facilitative psychological attitudes can be provided&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Rogers rejected the deterministic nature of both <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/psychoanalysis.html">psychoanalysis a</a>nd <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/behaviorism.html">behaviorism a</a>nd maintained that we behave as we do because of the way we perceive our situation. &#8220;As no one else can know how we perceive, we are the best experts on ourselves.&#8221; (Gross, 1992)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Believing strongly that theory should come out of practice rather than the other way round, Rogers developed his theory based on his work with emotionally troubled people and claimed that we have a remarkable capacity for self-healing and personal growth leading towards self- actualization. He placed emphasis on the person&#8217;s current perception and how we live in the here-and-now.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Rogers noticed that people tend to describe their current experiences by referring to themselves in some way, for example, &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s happening&#8221; or &#8220;I feel different to how I used to feel&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Central to Rogers&#8217; (1959) theory is the notion of self or <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/self-concept.html">self-concept.</a>  This is defined as &#8220;the organized, consistent set of perceptions and beliefs about oneself&#8221;.  It consists of all the ideas and values that characterize &#8216;I&#8217; and &#8216;me&#8217; and includes perception and valuing of &#8216;what I am&#8217; and</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8216;what I can do&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Consequently, the self concept  is a central component of our total experience  and influences both our perception of the world and perception of oneself. For instance, a woman who perceives herself as strong may well behave with confidence and come to see her actions as actions performed by someone who is confident.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">The self-concept does not necessarily always fit with reality, though, and the way we see ourselves may differ greatly from how others see us. For example, a person might be very interesting to others and yet consider himself to be boring.  He judges and evaluates this image he has of himself as a bore and this valuing will be reflected in his self-esteem.  The confident woman may have a high self-esteem and the man who sees himself as a bore may have a <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/self-esteem.html">low self-esteem,</a> presuming that strength/confidence are highly valued and that being boring is not.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>P</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong> <strong>C</strong><strong>entere</strong><strong>d Approach</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Not</strong><strong>e</strong>: Person centered therapy is also called <strong>c</strong><strong>lient centered therapy</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">One major difference between humanistic counselors and other therapists is that they refer to those in therapy as &#8216;clients&#8217;, not &#8216;patients&#8217;. This is because they see the therapist and client as equal partners rather than as an expert treating a patient.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Unlike other therapies the client is responsible for improving his or her life, not the therapist. This is a deliberate change from both psychoanalysis and behavioral therapies where the patient is diagnosed and treated by a doctor.  Instead, the client consciously and rationally decides for themselves what is wrong and what should be done about it. The therapist is more of a friend or counselor who listens and encourages on an equal level.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">One reason why Rogers (1951) rejected interpretation was that he believed that, although symptoms did arise from past experience, it was more useful for the client to focus on the present and future than on the past.  Rather than just liberating clients from their past, as psychodynamic therapists aim to do, Rogerians hope to help their clients to achieve personal growth and eventually to <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html#self">self-actualize.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">There is an almost total absence of techniques in Rogerian psychotherapy due to the unique character of each counseling relationship.  Of utmost importance, however, is the quality of the relationship between client and therapist.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">The therapeutic relationship&#8230;is the critical variable, not what the therapist says or does</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">If there are any techniques they are listening, accepting, understanding and sharing, which seem more attitude-orientated than skills-orientated.  In Corey&#8217;s (1991) view &#8216;a preoccupation with using techniques is seen [from the Rogerian standpoint] as depersonalizing the relationship&#8217;.  The Rogerian client-centered approach puts emphasis on the person coming to form an appropriate understanding of their world and themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">person enters person centered therapy in a state of incongruence.  It is the role of the therapists to reverse this situation. Rogers (1959) called his therapeutic approach client- centered or person-centered therapy because of the focus on the person’s subjective view of the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Rogers regarded everyone as a “potentially competent individual” who could benefit greatly from his form of therapy.  The purpose of Roger’s humanistic therapy is to increase a person’s feelings of self-worth, reduce the level of incongruence between the ideal and actual self, and help a person become more of a fully functioning person.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>C</strong><strong>or</strong><strong>e Conditions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Client-centered therapy operates according to three basic principles that reflect the attitude of the therapist to the client:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">
<ol style="text-align:left;">
<li>1. The therapist is <strong>congruen</strong><strong>t </strong>with the client.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="2">
<li>2. The therapist provides the client with <strong>uncond</strong><strong>itional positive regard</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="3">
<li>3. The therapist shows <strong>e</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>pathet</strong><strong>ic </strong>understanding to the client.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Congruence in Counseling</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/carl-rogers.html#congruence">Congruence i</a>s also called genuineness. Congruence is the most important attribute in counseling, according to Rogers.  This means that, unlike the psychodynamic therapist who generally maintains a &#8216;blank screen&#8217; and reveals little of their own personality in therapy, the Rogerian is keen to allow the client to experience  them as they really are.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">The therapist does not have a façade (like psychoanalysis), that is, the therapist&#8217;s internal and external experiences are one in the same. In short, the therapist is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Unconditional Positive Regard</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">The next Rogerian core condition is <strong>uncond</strong><strong>itional positive regard</strong>. Rogers believed that for people to grow and fulfill their potential it is important that they are valued as themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">This refers to the therapist&#8217;s deep and genuine caring for the client.  The therapist may not approve of some of the client&#8217;s actions, but the therapist does approve of the client. In short, the therapist needs an attitude of &#8220;I&#8217;ll accept you as you are.&#8221;  The person-centered counselor is thus careful to always maintain a positive attitude to the client, even when disgusted by the client&#8217;s actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Empathy</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">mpathy is the ability to understand what the client is feeling. This refers to the therapist&#8217;s ability to understand sensitively and accurately [but not sympathetically] the client&#8217;s experience and feelings in the here-and-now.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">An important part of the task of the person-centered counselor is to follow precisely what the client is feeling and to communicate to them that the therapist understands what they are feeling.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">In the words of Rogers (1975), accurate empathic understanding is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8216;If I am truly open to the way life is experienced by another person&#8230;if I can take his or her world into mine, then I risk seeing life in his or her way&#8230;and of being changed myself, and we all resist change. Since we all resist change, we tend to view the other person&#8217;s world only in our terms, not in his or hers. Then we analyze and evaluate it. We do not understand their world. But, when the therapist does understand how it truly feels to be in another person&#8217;s world, without wanting or trying to analyze or judge it, then the therapist and the client can truly blossom and grow in that climate&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Because the person-centered counselor places so much emphasis on genuineness and on being led by the client, they do not place the same emphasis on boundaries of time and technique as would a psychodynamic therapist.  If they judged it appropriate, a person- centered counselor might diverge considerably from orthodox counseling techniques.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">As Mearns and Thorne (1988) point out, we cannot understand person-centered counseling by its techniques alone. The person-centered counselor has a very positive and optimistic view</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">of human nature.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">The philosophy that people are essentially good, and that ultimately the individual knows what is right for them, is the essential ingredient of a successful person centered therapy as “all about loving”.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Te</strong><strong>n Tips for Client-Centred Counsellors</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">
<ol style="text-align:left;">
<li>1. Set clear boundaries</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">For example, when and how long you want the session to last. You may also want to rule out certain topics of conversation.</p>
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="2">
<li>2. The client knows best</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">The client is the expert on his/her own difficulties. It’s better to let the client explain what is wrong. Don’t fall into the trap of telling them what their problem is or how they should solve it.</p>
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="3">
<li>3. Act as a sounding board</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">One useful technique is to listen carefully to what the client is saying and then try to explain to him/her what you think he/she is telling you in your own words. This can not only help you clarify the client’s point of view, it can also help the client understand his/her feelings better and begin to look for a constructive way forward.</p>
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="4">
<li>4. Don’t be judgmental</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Some clients may feel that their personal problems mean that they fall short of the ‘ideal’. They may need to feel reassured that they will be accepted for the person that they are and not face rejection or disapproval.</p>
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="5">
<li>5. Don’t make decisions for them</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Remember advice is a dangerous gift. Also, some clients will not want to take responsibility for making their own decisions. They may need to be reminded  that nobody else can or should be allowed to choose for them. Of course you can still help them explore the consequences of</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">the options open to them.</p>
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="6">
<li>6. Concentrate on what they are really saying</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Sometimes this will not be clear at the outset. Often a client will not tell you what is really bothering him/her until he/she feels sure of you. Listen carefully – the problem you are initially presented with may not be the real problem at all.</p>
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="7">
<li>7. Be genuine</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">If you simply present yourself in your official role the client is unlikely to want to reveal personal details about themselves. This may mean disclosing things about yourself – not necessarily facts, but feelings as well. Don’t be afraid to do this – bearing in mind that you are under no obligation to disclose anything you do not want to.</p>
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="8">
<li>8. Accept negative emotions</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Some clients may have negative feelings about themselves, their family or even you. Try to work through their aggression without taking offence, but do not put up with personal abuse.</p>
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="9">
<li>9. How you speak can be more important than what you say</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">It is possible to convey a great deal through your tone of voice. Often it will be found helpful to slow down the pace of conversation. Short pauses where the client (and you) have time to reflect on the direction of the session can also be useful.</p>
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="10">
<li>10. I may not be the best person to help</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Knowing yourself and your own limitations can be just as important as understanding the client’s point of view. No person centred counsellor succeeds all the time. Sometimes you will be able to help but you will never know. Remember the purpose of a counselling session is not to make you feel good about yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Learning Check</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Joyce is a successful teacher and is liked by her colleagues. However Joyce has always dreamed of becoming a ballroom dancer. She spends much of her free time with her partner practising elaborate lifts and can often be seen twirling around the classroom during break times. Joyce is considering leaving teaching and becoming a professional dancer.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Her colleagues described her plans as ‘ridiculous’ and her parents who are very proud that their daughter is a teacher have told Joyce that they will not speak to her again if she does leave teaching to become a dancer. Joyce is beginning to feel sad and miserable.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Referring to features of humanistic psychology explain how Joyce’s situation may affect her personal growth. [8 marks]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>C</strong><strong>ar</strong><strong>l Rogers</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">WAHEED ALOMARI</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Carl Rogers (1902-1987) was a <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/humanistic.html">humanistic p</a>sychologist who agreed with the main assumptions of <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html">Abraham Maslow,</a> but added that for a person to &#8220;grow&#8221;, they need an environment that provides them with genuineness (openness and self-disclosure), acceptance (being seen with unconditional positive regard), and empathy (being listened to and understood).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Without these, relationships and healthy personalities will not develop as they should, much like a tree will not grow without sunlight and water.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Rogers believed that every person could achieve their goals, wishes, and desires in life. When, or rather if they did so, <em>self actualization </em>took place. This was one of Carl Rogers most important contributions to psychology, and for a person to reach their potential a number of factors must be satisfied.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Self Actualization</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;<em>Th</em><em>e organism has one basic tendency and striving &#8211; to actualize, maintain, and enhance the experiencing organism</em>” (Rogers, 1951, p. 487).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Rogers rejected the deterministic nature of both <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/psychoanalysis.html">psychoanalysis a</a>nd behaviorism and maintained that we behave as we do because of the way we perceive our situation. &#8220;As no one else can know how we perceive, we are the best experts on ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Carl Rogers (1959) believed that humans have one basic motive, that is the tendency to self-actualize &#8211; i.e., to fulfill one&#8217;s potential and achieve the highest level of &#8216;human- beingness&#8217; we can. Like a flower that will grow to its full potential if the conditions are right, but which is constrained by its environment, so people will flourish and reach their potential if their environment is good enough.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">However, unlike a flower, the potential of the individual human is unique, and we are meant to develop in different ways according to our personality. Rogers believed that people are inherently good and creative.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">They become destructive only when a poor self-concept or external constraints override the valuing process. Carl Rogers believed that for a person to achieve self-actualization they must be in a state of congruence.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">This means that self-actualization occurs when a person’s “<a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/self-concept.html#ideal">ideal self”</a> (i.e., who they would like to be) is congruent with their actual behavior (<a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/self-concept.html#image">self-image)</a>. Rogers describes an individual who is actualizing as a fully functioning person. The main determinant of whether we will become self-actualized is childhood experience.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">The Fully Functioning Person</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Rogers believed that every person could achieve their goal. This means that the person is in touch with the here and now, his or her subjective experiences and feelings, continually growing and changing.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">In many ways, Rogers regarded the fully functioning person as an ideal and one that</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">people do not ultimately achieve. It is wrong to think of this as an end or completion of life’s journey; rather it is a process of always becoming and changing.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Rogers identified five characteristics of the fully-functioning person:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">
<ol style="text-align:left;">
<li><strong>1</strong><strong>. Open to experience</strong>: both positive and negative emotions accepted. Negative feelings are not denied, but worked through (rather than resorting to ego defense mechanisms).</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="2">
<li><strong>2</strong><strong>. Existential living</strong>: in touch with different experiences as they occur in life, avoiding prejudging and preconceptions. Being able to live and fully appreciate the present, not always looking back to the past or forward to the future (e., living for the moment).</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="3">
<li><strong>3</strong><strong>. Trust feelings</strong>: feeling, instincts, and gut-reactions are paid attention to and trusted. People’s own decisions are the right ones, and we should trust ourselves to make the right choices.</li>
</ol>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">For Rogers, fully functioning people are well adjusted, well balanced and interesting to know. Often such people are high achievers in society.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Critics claim that the fully functioning person is a product of Western culture. In other cultures, such as Eastern cultures, the achievement of the group is valued more highly than the achievement of any one person.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Personality Development</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Central to Rogers&#8217; personality theory is the notion of self or <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/self-concept.html">self-concept</a>. This is defined as</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;the organized, consistent set of perceptions and beliefs about oneself.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">The self is the humanistic term for who we really are as a person. The self is our inner personality, and can be likened to the soul, or <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/psyche.html">Freud&#8217;s psyche.</a> The self is influenced by the experiences a person has in their life, and out interpretations of those experiences. Two primary sources that influence our self-concept are childhood experiences and evaluation by others.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">According to Rogers (1959), we want to feel, experience and behave in ways which are consistent with our self-image and which reflect what we would like to be like, our ideal- self. The closer our self-image and ideal-self are to each other, the more consistent or congruent we are and the higher our sense of self-worth.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">A person is said to be in a state of incongruence if some of the totality of their experience is unacceptable to them and is denied or distorted in the self-image.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">The humanistic approach states that the self is composed of concepts unique to ourselves. The self-concept includes three components:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Self-worth</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Self-worth (or <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/self-esteem.html">self-esteem)</a> comprises what we think about ourselves. Rogers believed feelings of self-worth developed in early childhood and were formed from the interaction of the child with the mother and father.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Self-image</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">How we see ourselves, which is important to good psychological health. Self-image includes the influence of our body image on inner personality.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">At a simple level, we might perceive ourselves as a good or bad person, beautiful or ugly. Self-image affects how a person thinks, feels and behaves in the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Ideal-self</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">This is the person who we would like to be. It consists of our goals and ambitions in life, and is dynamic – i.e., forever changing.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">The ideal self in childhood is not the ideal self in our teens or late twenties etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Positive Regard and Self Worth</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Carl Rogers (1951) viewed the child as having two basic needs: positive regard from other people and self-worth.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">How we think about ourselves, our feelings of self-worth are of fundamental importance both to psychological health and to the likelihood that we can achieve goals and ambitions in life and achieve self- actualization.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Self-worth may be seen as a continuum from very high to very low. For Carl Rogers (1959) a person who has high self-worth, that is, has confidence and positive feelings about him or herself, faces challenges in life, accepts failure and unhappiness at times, and is open with people.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">A person with low self-worth may avoid challenges in life, not accept that life can be painful and unhappy at times, and will be defensive and guarded with other people.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Rogers believed feelings of self-worth developed in early childhood and were formed from the interaction of the child with the mother and father. As a child grows older, interactions with significant others will affect feelings of self-worth.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Rogers believed that we need to be regarded positively by others; we need to feel valued, respected, treated with affection and loved. Positive regard is to do with how other people evaluate and judge us in social interaction. Rogers made a distinction between unconditional positive regard and conditional positive regard.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Unconditional Positive Regard</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Unconditional positive regards where parents, significant others (and the humanist therapist) accepts and loves the person for what he or she is. Positive regard is not withdrawn if the person does something wrong or makes a mistake.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">The consequences of unconditional positive regard are that the person feels free to try things out and make mistakes, even though this may lead to getting it worse at times.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">People who are able to self-actualize are more likely to have received unconditional positive regard from others, especially their parents in childhood.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Conditional Positive Regard</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Conditional positive regard is where positive regard, praise, and approval, depend upon the child, for example, behaving in ways that the parents think correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Hence the child is not loved for the person he or she is, but on condition that he or she behaves only in ways approved by the parent(s).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">At the extreme, a person who constantly seeks approval from other people is likely only to have experienced conditional positive regard as a child.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Congruence</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">A person’s <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/self-concept.html#ideal">ideal self</a> may not be consistent with what actually happens in life and experiences of the person. Hence, a difference may exist between a person’s ideal self and actual experience. This is called incongruence.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Where a person’s ideal self and actual experience are consistent or very similar, a state of congruence exists. Rarely, if ever, does a total state of congruence exist; all people experience a certain amount of incongruence.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">The development of congruence is dependent on unconditional positive regard. Carl Rogers believed that for a person to achieve self-actualization they must be in a state of congruence.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">According to Rogers, we want to feel, experience and behave in ways which are consistent with our self-image and which reflect what we would like to be like, our ideal-self.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">The closer our <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/self-concept.html#image">self-image a</a>nd ideal-self are to each other, the more consistent or congruent we are and the higher our sense of self-worth. A person is said to be in a state of incongruence if some of the totality of their experience is unacceptable to them and is denied or distorted in the self-image.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Incongruence is &#8220;a discrepancy between the actual experience of the organism and the self-picture of the individual insofar as it represents that experience.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">As we prefer to see ourselves in ways that are consistent with our self-image, we may use <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/defense-mechanisms.html">defense mechanisms</a> like denial or repression in order to feel less threatened by some of what we consider to be our undesirable feelings. A person whose self-concept is incongruent with her or his real feelings and experiences will defend because the truth hurts.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Carl Rogers Quotes</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;When I look at the world I&#8217;m pessimistic, but when I look at people I am optimistic.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;The very essence of the creative is its novelty, and hence we have no standard by which to judge it&#8221; (Rogers, 1961, p. 351).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;I have gradually come to one negative conclusion about the good life. It seems to me that the good life is not any fixed state. It is not, in my estimation, a state of virtue, or contentment, or nirvana, or happiness. It is not a condition in which the individual is adjusted or fulfilled or actualized. To use psychological terms, it is not a state of drive-reduction, or tension- reduction, or homeostasis&#8221; (Rogers, 1967, p. 185-186).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;The good life is a process, not a state of being. It is a direction not a destination&#8221; (Rogers,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">1967, p. 187).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">

<p style="text-align:left;">WAHEED ALOMARI</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy of needs is a motivational theory in psychology comprising a five-tier model of human needs, often depicted as hierarchical levels within a pyramid.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Needs lower down in the hierarchy must be satisfied before individuals can attend to needs higher up. From the bottom of the hierarchy upwards, the needs are: physiological, safety, love and belonging, esteem and self-</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">actualization.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>D</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>ficiency needs vs. growth needs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This five-stage model can be divided into deficiency needs and growth needs. The first four levels are often referred to as deficiency needs (<em>D-needs</em>), and the top level is known as growth or being needs (<em>B</em><em>-needs</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Deficiency needs arise due to deprivation and are said to motivate people when they are unmet. Also, the motivation to fulfill such needs will become stronger the longer the duration they are denied. For example, the longer a person goes without food, the more hungry they will become.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Maslow (1943) initially stated that individuals must satisfy lower level deficit needs before progressing on to meet higher level growth needs. However, he later clarified that satisfaction of a needs is not an “all-or-none” phenomenon, admitting that his earlier statements may have given “the false impression that a need must besatisfied 100 percent before the next need emerges” (1987, p.69).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">When a deficit need has been &#8216;more or less&#8217; satisfied it will go away, and our activities become habitually directed towards meeting the next set of needs that we have yet to satisfy. These then become our salient needs. However, growth needs continue to be felt and may even become stronger once they have been engaged.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Growth needs do not stem from a lack of something, but rather from a desire to grow as a person. Once these growth needs have been reasonably satisfied, one may be able to reach the highest level called self-actualization.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Every person is capable and has the desire to move up the hierarchy toward a level of self-actualization. Unfortunately, progress is often disrupted by a failure to meet lower-level needs. Life experiences, including divorce and loss of a job, may cause an individual to fluctuate between levels of the hierarchy.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Therefore, not everyone will move through the hierarchy in a uni-directional manner but may move back and forth between the different types of needs.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The original hierarchy of needs five-stage model includes:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Maslow (1943, 1954) stated that people are motivated to achieve certain needs and that some needs take precedence over others.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Our most basic need is for physical survival, and this will be the first thing that motivates our behavior. Once that level is fulfilled the next level up is what motivates us, and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The original hierarchy of needs five-stage model includes:</p>
<ol style="text-align:left;">
<li><strong> <u>Physiological needs</u> </strong>&#8211; these are biological requirements for Human survival, e.g. air, food, drink, shelter, clothing, warmth, sex, sleep.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:left;">If these needs are not satisfied the human body cannot function optimally. Maslow considered physiological needs the most important as all the other needs become secondary until these needs are met.</p>
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="2">
<li>2. <strong><u>Safety needs</u> </strong>&#8211; protection from elements, security, order, law, stability, freedom from fear.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="3">
<li>3. <strong><u>Love and belongingness needs</u> </strong>&#8211; after physiological and safety needs have been fulfilled, the third level of human needs is social and involves feelings of belongingness. The need for interpersonal relationships motivates behavior</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:left;">Examples include friendship, intimacy, trust, and acceptance, receiving and giving affection and love. Affiliating, being part of a group (family, friends, work).</p>
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="4">
<li><strong><u>Esteem needs</u> </strong>&#8211; which Maslow classified into two categories: (i) esteem for oneself (dignity, achievement, mastery, independence) and (ii) the desire for reputation or respect from others (e.g., status, prestige).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:left;">Maslow indicated that the need for respect or reputation is most important for children and adolescents and precedes real self-esteem or dignity.</p>
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="5">
<li><strong><u>Self-actualization needs</u> </strong>&#8211; realizing personal potential, self- fulfillment, seeking personal growth and peak experiences. A desire “to become everything one is capable of becoming” (Maslow, 1987, p. 64).</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align:center;">Maslow posited that human needs are arranged in a hierarchy:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;It is quite true that man lives by bread alone — when there is no bread. But what happens to man’s desires when there is plenty of bread and when his belly is chronically filled?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">At once other (and “higher”) needs emerge and these, rather than physiological hungers, dominate the organism. And when these in turn are satisfied, again new (and still “higher”) needs emerge and so on. This is what we mean by saying that the basic human needs are organized into</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">a hierarchy of relative prepotency&#8221; (Maslow, 1943, p. 375).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Maslow continued to refine his theory based on the concept of a hierarchy of needs over several decades (Maslow, 1943, 1962, 1987).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Regarding the structure of his hierarchy, Maslow (1987) proposed that the order in the hierarchy “is not nearly as rigid” (p. 68) as he may have implied in his earlier description.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Maslow noted that the order of needs might be flexible based on external circumstances or individual differences. For example, he notes that for some individuals, the need for self-esteem is more important than the need for love. For others, the need for creative fulfillment may supersede even the most basic needs.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Maslow (1987) also pointed out that most behavior is multi-motivated and noted that “any behavior tends to be determined by several or all of the basic needs simultaneously rather than by only one of them” (p. 71).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Hi</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>rarchy of needs summary</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(a) needs human beings are motivated by a hierarchy of needs.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(b) needs are organized in a hierarchy of prepotency in which more basic needs must be more or less met (rather than all or none) prior to higher needs.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(c) the order of needs is not rigid but instead may be flexible based on external circumstances or individual differences.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(d) most behavior is multi-motivated, that is, simultaneously determined by more than one basic need.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The expanded hierarchy of needs</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It is important to note that Maslow&#8217;s (1943, 1954) five-stage model has been expanded to include cognitive and aesthetic needs (Maslow, 1970a) and later transcendence needs (Maslow, 1970b).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Changes to the original five-stage model are highlighted and include a seven-stage model and an eight-stage model; both developed during the 1960s and</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The 1970s.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Self-actualization</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Instead of focusing on <a href="http://127.0.0.1:65314/content/b3a26xvEBcMc3XoeAAAM/Z6U0JA7/Zh6Gdd2/n5DCxVm/6nIM2Am/YooVAUU/xUKQfG8/abnormal-psychology.html">psychopathology a</a>nd what goes wrong with people, Maslow (1943) formulated a more positive account of human behavior which focused on what goes right. He was interested in human potential, and how we fulfill that potential.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Psychologist Abraham Maslow (1943, 1954) stated that human motivation is based on people seeking fulfillment and change through personal growth. Self- actualized people are those who were fulfilled and doing all they were capable of.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The growth of self-actualization (Maslow, 1962) refers to the need for personal growth and discovery that is present throughout a person’s life. For Maslow, a person is always &#8216;becoming&#8217; and never remains static in these terms. In self- actualization, a person comes to find a meaning to life that is important to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">As each individual is unique, the motivation for self-actualization leads people in different directions (Kenrick et al., 2010). For some people self- actualization can be achieved through creating works of art or literature, for others through sport, in the classroom, or within a corporate setting.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Maslow (1962) believed self-actualization could be measured through the concept of peak experiences. This occurs when a person experiences the world totally for what it is, and there are feelings of euphoria, joy, and wonder.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It is important to note that self-actualization is a continual process of becoming rather than a perfect state one reaches of a &#8216;happy ever after&#8217; (Hoffman, 1988).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Maslow offers the following description of self-actualization:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8216;It refers to the person’s desire for self-fulfillment, namely, to the tendency for him to become actualized in what he is potentially.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The specific form that these needs will take will of course vary greatly from person to person. In one individual it may take the form of the desire to be an ideal mother, in another it may be expressed athletically, and in still another it may be expressed in painting pictures or in inventions&#8217; (Maslow, 1943, p. 382–383).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Characteristics of self-actualized people</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Although we are all, theoretically, capable of self-actualizing, most of us will not do so, or only to a limited degree. Maslow (1970) estimated that only two percent of people would reach the state of self-actualization.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">He was especially interested in the characteristics of people whom he considered to have achieved their potential as individuals.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">By studying 18 people he considered to be self-actualized (including Abraham Lincoln and Albert Einstein) Maslow (1970) identified 15 characteristics of a self-actualized person.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Characteristics of self-actualizers:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li> They perceive reality efficiently and can tolerate uncertainty;</li>
<li> Accept themselves and others for what they are;</li>
<li> Spontaneous in thought and action;</li>
<li>Problem-centered (not self-centered);</li>
<li>Unusual sense of humor;</li>
<li>Able to look at life objectively;</li>
<li> Highly creative;</li>
<li> Resistant to enculturation, but not purposely unconventional;</li>
<li>Concerned for the welfare of humanity;</li>
<li> Capable of deep appreciation of basic life-experience;</li>
<li> Establish deep satisfying interpersonal relationships with a few people;</li>
<li> Peak experiences;</li>
<li>Need for privacy;</li>
<li>Democratic attitudes;</li>
<li>Strong moral/ethical standards.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>B</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>ha</strong><strong>v</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>or leading to self-actualization:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(a) Experiencing life like a child, with full absorption and concentration;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(b) Trying new things instead of sticking to safe paths;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(c) Listening to your own feelings in evaluating experiences instead of the voice of tradition, authority or the majority;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(d) Avoiding pretense (&#8216;game playing&#8217;) and being honest;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(e) Being prepared to be unpopular if your views do not coincide with those of the majority;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(f) Taking responsibility and working hard;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(g) Trying to identify your defenses and having the courage to give them up.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The characteristics of self-actualizers and the behaviors leading to self- actualization are shown in the list above. Although people achieve self- actualization in their own unique way, they tend to share certain characteristics. However, self-actualization is a matter of degree, &#8216;There are no perfect human beings&#8217; (Maslow,1970a, p. 176).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It is not necessary to display all 15 characteristics to become self-actualized, and not only self-actualized people will display them.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Maslow did not equate self-actualization with perfection. Self-actualization merely involves achieving one&#8217;s potential. Thus, someone can be silly, wasteful, vain and impolite, and still self-actualize. Less than two percent of</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">the population achieve self-actualization.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/carl-rogers.html"><strong>Roger’s Theory of Self-Actualization</strong></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Educational applications</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Maslow&#8217;s (1962) hierarchy of needs theory has made a major contribution to teaching and classroom management in schools. Rather than reducing behavior to a <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/operant-conditioning.html">response in the environment,</a> Maslow (1970a) adopts a holistic approach to education and learning.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Maslow looks at the complete physical, emotional, social, and intellectual qualities of an individual and how they impact on learning.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Applications of Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy theory to the work of the classroom teacher are obvious. Before a student&#8217;s cognitive needs can be met, they must first fulfill their basic physiological needs.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For example, a tired and hungry student will find it difficult to focus on learning. Students need to feel emotionally and physically safe and accepted within the classroom to progress and reach their full potential.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Maslow suggests students must be shown that they are valued and respected in the classroom, and the teacher should create a supportive environment. Students with a <a href="http://127.0.0.1:65314/content/b3a26xvEBcMc3XoeAAAM/yZhZbM8/jo7nKhA/FFEc8f2/HyW8Biv/gslBJ3x/6QI2Iz5/self-esteem.html">low self-esteem wi</a>ll not progress academically at an optimum rate until their self-esteem is strengthened.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Maslow (1971, p. 195) argued that a humanistic educational approach would develop people who are “stronger, healthier, and would take their own lives into their hands to a greater extent. With increased personal responsibility for one’s personal life, and witha rational set of values to guide one’s choosing, people would begin to actively change the society in which they lived”.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Critical evaluation</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The most significant limitation of Maslow&#8217;s theory concerns his methodology. Maslow formulated the characteristics of self-actualized individuals from undertaking a qualitative method called biographical analysis.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">He looked at the biographies and writings of 18 people he identified as being self-actualized. From these sources, he developed a list of qualities that seemed characteristic of this specific group of people, as opposed to humanity in general.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">From a <a href="http://127.0.0.1:65314/content/b3a26xvEBcMc3XoeAAAM/yZhZbM8/jo7nKhA/FFEc8f2/HyW8Biv/gslBJ3x/6QI2Iz5/science-psychology.html">scientific perspective,</a> there are numerous problems with this particular approach. First, it could be argued that biographical analysis as a method is extremely subjective as it is based entirely on the opinion of the researcher. Personal opinion is always prone to bias, which reduces</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:65314/content/b3a26xvEBcMc3XoeAAAM/yZhZbM8/jo7nKhA/FFEc8f2/HyW8Biv/gslBJ3x/6QI2Iz5/validity.html">validity o</a>f any data obtained. Therefore Maslow&#8217;s operational definition of self-actualization must not be blindly accepted as scientific fact.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Furthermore, Maslow&#8217;s biographical analysis focused on a biased sample of self-actualized individuals, prominently limited to highly educated white males (such as Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Albert Einstein, William James, Aldous Huxley, Beethoven).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Although Maslow (1970) did study self-actualized females, such as Eleanor</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Roosevelt and Mother Teresa, they comprised a small proportion of</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">his <a href="http://127.0.0.1:65314/content/b3a26xvEBcMc3XoeAAAM/yZhZbM8/jo7nKhA/FFEc8f2/HyW8Biv/gslBJ3x/6QI2Iz5/sampling.html">sample.</a> This makes it difficult to generalize his theory to females and individuals from lower social classes or different ethnicity. Thus questioning the population validity of Maslow&#8217;s findings.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Furthermore, it is extremely difficult to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:65314/content/b3a26xvEBcMc3XoeAAAM/yZhZbM8/jo7nKhA/FFEc8f2/HyW8Biv/gslBJ3x/6QI2Iz5/experimental-method.html">empirically test M</a>aslow&#8217;s concept of self-actualization in a way that causal relationships can be established.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Another criticism concerns Maslow&#8217;s assumption that the lower needs must be satisfied before a person can achieve their potential and self-actualize. This is</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">not always the case, and therefore Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy of needs in some aspects has been falsified.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Through examining cultures in which large numbers of people live in poverty (such as India), it is clear that people are still capable of higher order needs such as love and belongingness. However, this should not occur, as according to Maslow, people who have difficulty achieving very basic physiological needs (such as food, shelter, etc.) are not capable of meeting higher growth needs.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Also, many creative people, such as authors and artists (e.g., Rembrandt and Van Gogh) lived in poverty throughout their lifetime, yet it could be argued that they achieved self-actualization.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Psychologists now conceptualize motivation as a pluralistic behavior, whereby needs can operate on many levels simultaneously. A person may be motivated by higher growth needs at the same time as lower level deficiency needs.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Contemporary research by Tay and Diener (2011) has tested Maslow’s theory by analyzing the data of 60,865 participants from 123 countries, representing every major region of the world. The survey was conducted from 2005 to2010.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Respondents answered questions about six needs that closely resemble those in Maslow&#8217;s model: basic needs (food, shelter); safety; social needs (love, support); respect; mastery; and autonomy. They also rated their well-being across three discrete measures: life evaluation (a person&#8217;s view of his or her life as a whole), positive feelings (day-to-day instances of joy or pleasure), and negative feelings (everyday experiences of sorrow, anger, or stress).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The results of the study support the view that universal human needs appear to exist regardless of cultural differences. However, the ordering of the needs within the hierarchy was not correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Although the most basic needs might get the most attention when you don&#8217;t have them,&#8221; Diener explains, &#8220;you don&#8217;t need to fulfill them in order to get benefits [from the others].&#8221; Even when we are hungry, for instance, we can be happy with our friends. &#8220;They&#8217;re like vitamins,&#8221; Diener says about how the needs work independently. &#8220;We need them all.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>H</strong><strong>u</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>m</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">WAHEED ALOMARI</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Humanistic, humanism and humanist are terms in psychology relating to an approach which studies the whole person, and the uniqueness of each individual. Essentially, these terms refer the same approach in psychology.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">The humanistic approach in psychology developed as a rebellion against what some psychologists saw as the limitations of the behaviorist and psychodynamic psychology. The humanistic approach is thus often called the “third force” in psychology after psychoanalysis and behaviorism (Maslow, 1968).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Humanism rejected the assumptions of the <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/behaviorism.html">behaviorist perspective w</a>hich is characterized as deterministic, focused on reinforcement of stimulus-response behavior and heavily dependent on animal research.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Humanistic psychology also rejected the <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/psychodynamic.html">psychodynamic approach b</a>ecause it is also deterministic, with unconscious irrational and instinctive forces determining human thought and behavior.  Both behaviorism and psychoanalysis are regarded as dehumanizing by humanistic psychologists.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>H</strong><strong>u</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>an</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>c</strong> <strong>psycho</strong><strong>logy expanded its influence throughout the 1970s and the 1980s.  Its impact can be understood in terms of three major areas</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">1) It offered a new set of values for approaching an understanding of human nature and the human condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">2) It offered an expanded horizon of methods of inquiry in the study of human behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">3) It offered a broader range of more effective methods in the professional practice of <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/client-centred-therapy.html">psychotherapy.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Basic Assumptions</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Humanistic psychology begins with the existential assumptions that people  have free will:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Personal agency is the humanistic term for the exercise of free will.  Personal agency refers to the choices we make in life, the paths we go down and their consequences.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">People are basically good, and have an innate need to make themselves and the world better:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">The humanistic approach emphasizes the personal worth of the individual, the centrality of human values, and the creative, active nature of human beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">The approach is optimistic and focuses on noble human capacity to overcome hardship, pain and despair.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">People are motivated to self-actualize:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Self-actualization concerns psychological growth, fulfillment and satisfaction in life.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Both Rogers and Maslow regarded personal growth and fulfillment in life as a basic human motive. This means that each person, in different ways, seeks to grow psychologically and continuously enhance themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">However, Rogers and Maslow both describe different ways of how self-actualization can be achieved.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">The subjective, conscious experiences of the individual is most important:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Humanistic psychologists argue that objective  reality is less important than a person&#8217;s subjective perception and understanding of the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Sometimes the humanistic approach is called phenomenological. This means that personality is studied from the point of view of the individual’s subjective experience.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">For <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/carl-rogers.html">Rogers t</a>he focus of psychology is not behavior ( <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/operant-conditioning.html">Skinner)</a>, the unconscious (<a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/Sigmund-Freud.html">Freud)</a>, thinking (<a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/wundt.html">Wundt)</a> or the human brain but how individuals perceive and interpret events. <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/self-concept.html">Rogers is therefore important because he redirected psychology towards the study of the</a> <u>s</u><u>e</u><u>l</u><u>f</u>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Humanism rejects scientific methodology:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Rogers and Maslow placed little value on <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/science-psychology.html">scientific psychology,</a> especially the use of the psychology laboratory to investigate both human and animal behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Humanism rejects scientific methodology like experiments and typically uses qualitative <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/interviews.html#unstructured">research methods. For example, diary accounts, </a><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/questionnaires.html#open">open-ended questionnaires,</a> <u>un</u><u>s</u><u>t</u><u>r</u><u>u</u><u>c</u><u>t</u><u>u</u><u>r</u><u>e</u><u>d</u> <u>i</u><u>n</u><u>t</u><u>e</u><u>r</u><u>v</u><u>ie</u><u>w</u><u>s</u> and unstructured observations.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Qualitative research is useful for studies at the individual level, and to find out, in depth, the ways in which people think or feel (e.g. <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/case-study.html">case studies)</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">The way to really understand other people is to sit down and talk with them, share their experiences and be open to their feelings.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Humanism rejected <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/comparative-psychology.html">comparative psychology (</a>the study of animals) because it does not tell us anything about the unique properties of human beings:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Humanism views human beings as fundamentally different from other animals, mainly because humans are conscious beings capable of thought, reason and language.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For humanistic psychologists’ research on animals, such as rats, pigeons, or monkeys held little value.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Research on such animals can tell us, so they argued, very little about human thought, behavior and experience.</p>

<p>Qualitative data gives genuine insight and more holistic information into behavior. Highlights the value of more individualistic and idiographic methods of study.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critical Evaluation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The humanistic approach has been applied to relatively few areas of psychology compared to the other approaches.  Therefore, its contributions are limited to areas such as <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/client-centred-therapy.html">therapy,</a> abnormality, <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html">motivation a</a>nd personality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A possible reason for this lack of impact on academic psychology perhaps lies with the fact that humanism deliberately adopts a non-scientific approach to studying humans. Humanistic psychologists rejected a rigorous scientific approach to psychology because they saw it as dehumanizing and unable to capture the richness of conscious experience. In many ways the rejection of <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/science-psychology.html">scientific psychology i</a>n the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s was a backlash to the dominance of the behaviorist approach in North American psychology. For example their belief in <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/freewill-determinism.html">free-will</a> is in direct opposition to the deterministic laws of science.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the areas investigated by humanism, such as consciousness and emotion are very difficult to scientifically study. The outcome of such scientific limitations means that there is a lack of empirical evidence to support the key theories of the approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the flip side to this is that humanism can gain a better insight into an individual&#8217;s behavior through the use of qualitative methods, such as unstructured interviews.  The approach also helped to provide a more holistic view of human behavior, in contrast to the reductionist position of science.</p>
