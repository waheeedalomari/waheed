<p dir="ltr">WAHEED ALOMARI</p>
<p dir="ltr">The multistore model of memory (also known as the modal model) was proposed by Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968) and is a structural model. They proposed that memory consisted of three stores: a sensory register, short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Information passes from store to store in a linear way, and has been described as an <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/information-processing.html">information processing m</a>odel (like a computer) with an input, process and output.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Information is detected by the sense organs and enters the sensory memory. If attended to this information enters the short term memory.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Information from the short-term memory is transferred to the long-term memory only if that information is rehearsed (i.e. repeated). If maintenance rehearsal (repition) does not occur, then information is forgotten, and lost from short term memory through the processes of displacement or decay.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Memory Stores</p>
<p dir="ltr">Each store is a unitary structure and has its own characteristics in terms of <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/memory.html">encoding, capacity and duration.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Encod</strong><strong>ing </strong>is the way information is changed so that it can be stored in the memory.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are three main ways in which information can be encoded (changed):</p>
<p dir="ltr">1. visual (picture),</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. acoustic (sound),</p>
<p dir="ltr">3. semantic (meaning).</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Capac</strong><strong>ity </strong>concerns how much information can be stored.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Durat</strong><strong>ion </strong>refers to the period of time information can last in the memory stores.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sensory Memory</p>
<p dir="ltr">Duration: ¼ to ½ second</p>
<p dir="ltr">Capacity: all sensory experience (v. larger capacity)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Encoding: sense specific (e.g. different stores for each sense)</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/short-term-memory.html">Short Term Memory</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Duration: 0-18 seconds</p>
<p dir="ltr">Capacity: 7 +/- 2 items</p>
<p dir="ltr">Encoding: mainly auditory</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/long-term-memory.html">Long Term Memory</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Duration: Unlimited</p>
<p dir="ltr">Capacity: Unlimited</p>
<p dir="ltr">Encoding: Mainly Semantic (but can be visual and auditory)</p>

<p dir="ltr">Key Studies</p>
<p dir="ltr">Glanzer and Cunitz showed that when participants are presented with a list of words, they tend to remember the first few and last few words and are more likely to forget those in the middle of the list, i.e. the serial position effect.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This supports the existence of separate LTM and STM stores because they observed a primacy and recency effect.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Words early on in the list were put into long term memory (primacy effect) because the person has time to rehearse the word, and words from the end went into short term memory (recency effect).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other compelling evidence to support this distinction between STM and LTM is the case of KF (Shallice &amp; Warrington, 197) who had been in a motorcycle crash where he had sustained brain damage. His LTM seemed to be unaffected but he was only able to recall the last bit of information he had heard in his STM.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Critical Evaluation</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Strength</strong><strong>s</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">One strength of the multistore model is that is gives us a good understanding of the structure and process of the STM. This is good because this allows researchers to expand on this model. This means researchers can do experiments to improve on this model and make it more valid and they can prove what the stores actually do. Therefore, the model is influential as it has generated a lot of research into memory.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many memory studies provide evidence to support the distinction between STM and LTM (in terms of encoding, duration and capacity). The model can account for <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/primacy-recency.html">primacy &amp; recency effects.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The model is supported by studies of amnesiacs: For example the HM case study. HM</p>
<p dir="ltr">is still alive but has marked problems in long-term memory after brain surgery. He has remembered little of personal (death of mother and father) or public events (Watergate, Vietnam War) that have occurred over the last 45 years. However his short-term memory remains intact.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>W</strong><strong>eaknesse</strong><strong>s</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The model is oversimplified, in particular when it suggests that both short-term and long-term memory each operate in a single, uniform fashion. We now know is this not the case.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It has now become apparent that both short-term and long-term memory are more complicated that previously thought. For example, the <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/working%20memory.html">Working Model of Memory</a> proposed by Baddeley and Hitch (1974) showed that short term memory is more than just one simple unitary store and comprises different components (e.g. central executive, Visuospatial etc.).</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the case of long-term memory, it is unlikely that different kinds of knowledge, such as remembering how to play a computer game, the rules of subtraction and remembering what we did yesterday are all stored within a single, long-term memory store. Indeed different types of long-term memory have been identified, namely episodic (memories of events), procedural (knowledge of how to do things) and semantic (general knowledge).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rehearsal is considered a too simple explanation to account for the transfer of information from STM to LTM. For instance, the model ignores factors such as motivation, effect and strategy (e.g. mnemonics) which underpin learning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also, rehearsal is not essential to transfer information into LTM. For example, why are we able to recall information which we did not rehearse (e.g. swimming) yet unable to recall information which we have rehearsed (e.g. reading your notes while revising). Therefore, the role of rehearsal as a means of transferring from STM to LTM is much less important than Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968) claimed in their model.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The models main emphasis was on structure and tends to neglect the process elements of memory (e.g. it only focuses on attention and maintenance rehearsal). For example, elaboration rehearsal leads to recall of information than just maintenance rehearsal. Elaboration rehearsal involves a more meaningful analysis (e.g. images, thinking, associations etc.) of information and leads to better recall. For example, giving words a meaning or linking them with previous knowledge. These limitations are dealt with by the <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/levelsofprocessing.html">levels of processing model</a> (Craik, &amp; Lockhart, 1972).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Note: although rehearsal was initially described by Atkinson and Shiffrin as maintenance rehearsal (repition of information), Shiffrin later suggested that rehearsal could be elaborative (Raaijmakers, &amp; Shiffrin, 2003).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/memory/multi-store_model.htm">multi store model</a> has been criticized for being a passive/one way/linear model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Short Term Memory</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">WAHEED ALOMARI</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Short-term memory (STM) is the second stage of the multi-store memory model proposed by the Atkinson-Shiffrin. The duration of STM seems to be between 15 and 30 seconds, and the capacity about 7 items.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Short term memory has three key aspects:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">limited capacity (only about 7 items can be stored at a time)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">limited duration (storage is very fragile and information can be lost with distraction or passage of time)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">encoding (primarily acoustic, even translating visual information into sounds).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There are two ways in which capacity is tested, one being span, the other being recency effect.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The Magic number 7 (plus or minus two) provides evidence for the capacity of short term memory. Most adults can store between 5 and 9 items in their short-term memory.  This idea was put forward by Miller (1956) and he called it the magic number 7. He though that short term memory could hold 7 (plus or minus 2 items) because it only had a certain number of “slots” in which items could be stored.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">However, Miller didn’t specify the amount of information that can be held in each slot. Indeed, if we can “chunk” information together we can store a lot more information in our short term memory.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Miller’s theory is supported by evidence from various studies, such as Jacobs (1887). He used the digit span test with every letter in the alphabet and numbers apart from “w” and “7” because they had two syllables. He found out that people find it easier to recall numbers rather than letters. The average span for letters was 7.3 and for numbers it was 9.3.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The duration of short term memory seems to be between 15 and 30 seconds, according to Atkinson and Shiffrin (1971). Items can be kept in short term memory by repeating them verbally (acoustic encoding), a process known as rehearsal.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Using a technique called the Brown-Peterson technique which prevents the possibility of retrieval by having participants count backwards in 3s.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Peterson and Peterson (1959) showed that the longer the delay, the less information is recalled. The rapid loss of information from memory when rehearsal is prevented is taken as an indication of short term memory having a limited duration.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Baddeley and Hitch (1974) have developed an alternative model of short-term memory which they call working memory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Long-Term Memory</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>WAHEED ALOMARI</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Long-term memory (LTM) the final stage of the multi-store memory model proposed by the</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Atkinson-Shiffrin, providing the lasting retention of information and skills.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Theoretically, the capacity of long-term memory could be unlimited, the main constraint on recall being accessibility rather than availability.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Duration might be a few minutes or a lifetime. Suggested encoding modes are semantic</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(meaning) and visual (pictorial) in the main but can be acoustic also.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Bahrick et al. (1975) investigated what they called very long-term memory (VLTM). Nearly</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">400 participants aged 17 – 74 were tested. There were various tests including: A free recall test, where participants tried to remember names of people in a graduate class. A photo recognition test, consisting of 50 pictures.  A name recognition test for ex-school friends.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Results of the study showed that participants who were tested within 15 years of graduation were about 90% accurate in identifying names and faces. After 48 years they were accurate 80% for verbal and 70% visual. Free recall was worse. After 15 years it was</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">60% and after 48 years it was 30% accurate.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Types of Long-Term Memory</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">One of the earliest and most influential distinctions of long-term memory was proposed by Tulving (1972).  He proposed a distinction between episodic, semantic and procedural memory.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Procedural Memory</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Procedural memory is a part of the long-term memory is responsible for knowing how to do things, i.e. memory of motor skills. It does not involve conscious (i.e. it’s unconscious &#8211; automatic) thought and is not declarative.  For example, procedural memory would involve knowledge of how to ride a bicycle.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Semantic Memory</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Semantic memory is a part of the long-term memory responsible for storing information about the world.  This includes knowledge about the meaning of words, as well as general knowledge. For example, London is the capital of England. It involves conscious thought and is declarative.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Episodic Memory</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Episodic memory s a part of the long-term memory responsible for storing information about events (i.e. episodes) that we have experienced in our lives. It involves conscious thought and is declarative.  An example would be a memory of our 1st day at school.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Cohen and Squire (1980) drew a distinction between declarative <strong>know</strong><strong>ledge and procedural knowledge</strong>. Procedural knowledge involves “knowing how” to do things. It included skills, such as “knowing how” to playing the piano, ride a bike; tie your shoes and other motor skills. It does not involve conscious thought (i.e. it’s unconscious &#8211; automatic). For example, we brush our teeth with little or no awareness of the skills involved.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Whereas, declarative knowledge involves “knowing that”, for example London is the capital of England, zebras are animals, your mum’s birthday etc.  Recalling information from declarative memory involves some degree of conscious effort – information is consciously brought to mind and “declared”.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The knowledge that we hold in <strong>se</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>ant</strong><strong>ic and episodic memories focuses </strong>on “knowing that” something is the case (i.e. declarative).  For example, we might have a semantic memory for knowing that Paris is the capital of France, and we might have an episodic memory for knowing that we caught the bus to college today.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Evidence for the distinction between declarative and procedural memory has come from research on patients with amnesia. Typically, amnesic patients have great difficulty in retaining episodic and semantic information following the onset of amnesia. Their memory for events and knowledge acquired before the onset of the condition tends to remain</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">intact, but they can’t store new episodic or semantic memories. In other words, it appears that their ability to retain declarative information is impaired.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">However, their procedural memory appears to be largely unaffected. They can recall skills they have already learned (e.g. riding a bike) and acquire new skills (e.g. learning to drive).</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">“Memory is the process of maintaining information over time.” (Matlin, 2005) “Memory is the means by which we draw on our past experiences in order to use this</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">information in the present’ (Sternberg, 1999).</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Memory is essential to all our lives. Without a memory of the past, we cannot operate in the present or think about the future. We would not be able to remember what we did yesterday, what we have done today or what we plan to do tomorrow. Without memory, we could not learn anything.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Memory is involved in processing vast amounts of information. This information takes many different forms, e.g. images, sounds or meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For psychologists the term memory covers three important aspects of information processing:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Memory Encoding</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">When information comes into our memory system (from sensory input), it needs to be changed into a form that the system can cope with, so that it can be stored. Think of this as similar to changing your money into a different currency when you travel from one country to another. For example, a word which is seen (in a book) may be stored if it is changed (encoded) into a sound or a meaning (i.e. semantic processing).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There are three main ways in which information can be encoded (changed):</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong> Visual (picture)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong> Acoustic (sound)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong> Semantic (meaning)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">For example, how do you remember a telephone number you have looked up in the phone book? If you can see it then you are using visual coding, but if you are repeating it to yourself you are using acoustic coding (by sound).</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Evidence suggests that this is the principle coding system in short-term memory (STM)</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">is acoustic coding. When a person is presented with a list of numbers and letters, they will try to hold them in STM by rehearsing them (verbally). Rehearsal is a verbal process regardless of whether the list of items is presented acoustically (someone reads them out), or visually (on a sheet of paper).</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">The principle encoding system in long-term memory (LTM) appears to be semantic coding (by meaning). However, information in LTM can also be coded both visually and acoustically.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Memory Storage</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">This concerns the nature of memory stores, i.e., where the information is stored, how long the memory lasts for (duration), how much can be stored at any time (capacity) and what kind of information is held. The way we store information affects the way we retrieve it. There has been a significant amount of research regarding the differences between <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/short-term-memory.html">Short Term Memory (</a>STM ) and <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/long-term-memory.html">Long Term Memory (</a>LTM).</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Most adults can store between 5 and 9 items in their short-term memory. Miller (1956) put this idea forward and he called it the magic number 7. He thought that short-term memory capacity was 7 (plus or minus 2) items because it only had a certain number of “slots” in which items could be stored.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">However, Miller didn’t specify the amount of information that can be held in each slot.  Indeed, if we can “chunk” information together we can store a lot more information in our short-term memory. In contrast, the capacity of LTM is thought to be unlimited.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Information can only be stored for a brief duration in STM (0-30 seconds), but LTM</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">can last a lifetime.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Memory Retrieval</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">This refers to getting information out storage. If we can’t remember something, it may be because we are unable to retrieve it. When we are asked to retrieve something from memory, the differences between STM and LTM become very clear.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">STM is stored and retrieved sequentially. For example, if a group of participants are given a list of words to remember, and then asked to recall the fourth word on the list, participants go through the list in the order they heard it in order to retrieve the information.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">LTM is stored and retrieved by association. This is why you can remember what you went upstairs for if you go back to the room where you first thought about it.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Organizing information can help aid retrieval. You can organize information in sequences (such as alphabetically, by size or by time). Imagine a patient being discharged from hospital whose treatment involved taking various pills at various times, changing their dressing and doing exercises. If the doctor gives these instructions in the order which they must be carried out throughout the day (i.e., in the sequence of time), this will help the patient remember them.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Criticisms of Memory Experiments</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">A large part of the research on memory is based on <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/experimental-method.html">experiments c</a>onducted in laboratories. Those who take part in the experiments &#8211; the participants &#8211; are asked to perform tasks such as recalling lists of words and numbers. Both the setting &#8211; the laboratory &#8211; and the tasks are a long way from everyday life. In many cases, the setting is artificial and the tasks fairly meaningless. Does this matter?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Psychologists use the term ecological validity to refer to the extent to which the findings of research studies can be generalized to other settings. An experiment has high ecological validity if its findings can be generalized, that is applied or extended, to settings outside the laboratory.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">It is often assumed that if an experiment is realistic or true-to-life, then there is a greater likelihood that its findings can be generalized. If it is not realistic (if the laboratory setting and the tasks are artificial) then there is less likelihood that the findings can be generalized. In this case, the experiment will have low ecological validity.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Many experiments designed to investigate memory have been criticized for having low ecological validity. First, the laboratory is an artificial situation. People are removed from their normal social settings and asked to take part in a psychological experiment.  They are directed by an &#8216;experimenter&#8217; and may be placed in the company of complete strangers. For many people, this is a brand-new experience, far removed from their everyday lives. Will this setting affect their actions, will they behave normally?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Often, the tasks participants are asked to perform can appear artificial and meaningless. Few, if any, people would attempt to memorize and recall a list of unconnected words in their daily lives. And it is not clear how tasks such as this relate to the use of memory in everyday life. The artificiality of many experiments has led some researchers to question whether their findings can be generalized to real life.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">As a result, many memory experiments have been criticized for having low ecological validity.</p>
