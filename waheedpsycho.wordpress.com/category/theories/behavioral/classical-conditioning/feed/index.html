<p style="text-align:left;">Classical conditioning theory involves learning a new behavior via the process of</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">association. In simple terms two stimuli are linked together to produce a new learned</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">response in a person or animal.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">John Watson proposed that the process of classical conditioning (based on Pavlov’s</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">observations) was able to explain all aspects of human psychology.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Everything from speech to emotional responses was simply patterns of stimulus and</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">response. Watson denied completely the existence of the mind or consciousness. Watson</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">believed that all individual differences in behavior were due to different experiences of</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">learning. He famously said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;Give me a dozen healthy infants, well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">in and I&#8217;ll guarantee to take anyone at random and train him to become any type of specialist I</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">might select &#8211; doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief and, yes, even beggar-man and thief,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations and the race of his</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">ancestors” (Watson, 1924, p. 104).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Classical Conditioning Examples</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Classical conditioning theory involves learning a new behavior via the process of</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">association. In simple terms, two stimuli are linked together to produce a new learned</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">response in a person or animal. There are three stages of classical conditioning. At each</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">stage the stimuli and responses are given special scientific terms:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Stage 1: Before Conditioning</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In this stage, the unconditioned stimulus (UCS) produces an unconditioned response</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(UCR) in an organism. In basic terms, this means that a stimulus in the environment has</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">produced a behavior/response which is unlearned (i.e., unconditioned) and therefore is a</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">natural response that has not been taught. In this respect, no new behavior has been</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">learned yet.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For example, a stomach virus (UCS) would produce a response of nausea (UCR). In</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">another example, a perfume (UCS) could create a response of happiness or desire (UCR)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This stage also involves another stimulus which has no effect on a person and is called the</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">neutral stimulus (NS). The NS could be a person, object, place, etc. The neutral stimulus</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">in classical conditioning does not produce a response until it is paired with the</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">unconditioned stimulus.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Stage 2: During Conditioning</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">During this stage, a stimulus which produces no response (i.e., neutral) is associated with</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">the unconditioned stimulus at which point it now becomes known as the conditioned</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">stimulus (CS).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For example, a stomach virus (UCS) might be associated with eating certain food such</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">as chocolate (CS). Also, perfume (UCS) might be associated with a specific person (CS).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Often during this stage, the UCS must be associated with the CS on several</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">occasions, or trials, for learning to take place. However, one trail learning can happen on</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">certain occasions when an association doesn&#8217;t need to be strengthened over time</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(such as being sick after food poisoning or drinking too much alcohol).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Stage 3: After Conditioning</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Now the conditioned stimulus (CS) has been associated with the unconditioned stimulus</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(UCS) to create a new conditioned response (CR).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For example, a person (CS) who has been associated with nice perfume (UCS) is now</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">found attractive (CR). Also, chocolate (CS) which was eaten before a person was sick with</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">a virus (UCS) now produces a response of nausea (CR).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">showed no fear of any of these stimuli. However, what did startle him and cause him to be</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">afraid as if a hammer was struck against a steel bar behind his head. The sudden loud</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">noise would cause &#8220;little Albert to burst into tears.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">When Little Albert was just over 11 months old, the white rat was presented, and seconds</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">later the hammer was struck against the steel bar.  This was done seven times over the</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">next seven weeks, and each time Little Albert burst into tears. By now little Albert only had</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">to see the rat and he immediately showed every sign of fear. He would cry (whether or not</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">the hammer was hit against the steel bar) and he would attempt to crawl away.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Also, Watson and Rayner found that Albert developed phobias of objects which</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">shared characteristics with the rat; including the family dog, a fur coat, some cotton wool</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">and a Father Christmas mask! This process is known as generalization.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Watson and Rayner had shown that classical conditioning could be used to create a</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">phobia. A phobia is an irrational fear, i.e., a fear that is out of proportion to the danger. Over</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">the next few weeks and months, Little Albert was observed and ten days after conditioning</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">his fear of the rat was much less marked. This dying out of a learned response is called</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">extinction. However, even after a full month it was still evident, and the association could be</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">renewed by repeating the original procedure a few times.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Classical Conditioning in the Classroom</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The implications of classical conditioning in the classroom are less important than those of</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">operant conditioning, but there is a still need for teachers to try to make sure that students</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">associate positive emotional experiences with learning.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">If a student associates negative emotional experiences with school, then this can obviously</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">have bad results, such as creating a school phobia.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For example, if a student is bullied at school, they may learn to associate the school with</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">fear. It could also explain why some students show a particular dislike of certain subjects</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">that continue throughout their academic careers. This could happen if a student is humiliated</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">or punished in class by a teacher.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Critical Evaluation</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Classical conditioning emphasizes the importance of learning from the environment, and</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">supports nurture over nature. However, it is limiting to describe behavior solely in terms of</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">either nature or nurture, and attempts to do this underestimate the complexity of human</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">behavior. It is more likely that behavior is due to an interaction between nature (biology)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">and nurture (environment).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A strength of classical conditioning theory is that it is scientific. This is because it&#8217;s based</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">on empirical evidence carried out by controlled experiments. For example, Pavlov (1902)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">showed how classical conditioning could be used to make a dog salivate to the sound of a</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">bell.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Classical conditioning is also a reductionist explanation of behavior. This is because a</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">complex behavior is broken down into smaller stimulus-response units of behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Supporters of a reductionist approach say that it is scientific. Breaking complicated</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">behaviors down to small parts means that they can be scientifically tested. However, so would argue that the reductionist view lacks validity. Thus, while reductionism is useful, it</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">can lead to incomplete explanations.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A final criticism of classical conditioning theory is that it is deterministic. This means that ideas do not allow for any degree of free will in the individual. Accordingly, a person has no</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">control over the reactions they have learned from classical conditioning, such as a phobia</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The deterministic approach also has important implications for psychology as a science.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Scientists are interested in discovering laws that can then be used to predict events.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">However, by creating general laws of behavior, deterministic psychology underestimates</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">the uniqueness of human beings and their freedom to choose their own destiny.</p>
