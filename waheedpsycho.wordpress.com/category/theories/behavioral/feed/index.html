										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Behavioral Therapy</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">WAHEED ALOMARI</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/behaviorism.html">Behaviorism c</a>onceptualize psychological disorders as the result of maladaptive learning, as people are born tabula rasa (a blank slate). They do not assume that sets of symptoms reflect single underlying causes.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/classical-conditioning.html">Behavioral therapies (also called behavior modification) are based on the theories of classical</a> <u>a</u><u>n</u><u>d</u> <u>o</u><u>p</u><u>e</u><u>r</u><u>a</u><u>n</u><u>t</u> <u>cond</u><u>itioning</u>. The premise is that all behavior is learned; faulty learning (i.e. conditioning) is the cause of abnormal behavior. Therefore, the individual has to learn the correct or acceptable behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">An important feature of behavioral therapy is its focus on current problems and behavior, and on attempts to remove behavior the patient finds troublesome.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This contrasts greatly with psychodynamic therapy (re: <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/psychoanalysis.html">Freud)</a>, where the focus is much more on trying to uncover unresolved conflicts from childhood (i.e. the cause of abnormal behavior).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Classical conditioning</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The theory of classical conditioning suggests a response is learned and repeated through immediate association. Behavioral therapies based on classical conditioning aim to break the association between stimulus and undesired response (e.g. phobia, additional etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Originally this type of therapy was known as behaviour modification but, these days, it is usually referred to as applied behaviour analysis. Examples include:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Aversion Therapy</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This process pairs undesirable behaviour with some form of aversive stimulus with the aim of reducing unwanted behaviour. For example, alcoholics enjoy going to pubs and consuming large amounts of alcohol</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Aversion therapy involves associating such stimuli and behavior with a very unpleasant unconditioned stimulus, such as an electric shock.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The client thus learns to associate the undesirable behavior with the electric shock, and a link is formed between the undesirable behavior and the reflex response to an electric shock.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In the case of alcoholism, what is often done is to require the client to take a sip of alcohol while under the effect of a nausea-inducing drug.  Sipping the drink is followed almost at once by vomiting. In future the smell of alcohol produces a memory of vomiting and should stop the patient wanting a drink.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">More controversially, aversion therapy has been used to &#8220;cure&#8221; homosexuals by electrocuting them if they become aroused to specific stimuli.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Critical Evaluation</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Apart from ethical considerations, there are two other issues relating to the use of aversion therapy.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">First, it is not very clear how the shocks or drugs have their effects.  It may be that they make the previously attractive stimulus (e.g. sight/smell/taste of alcohol) aversive, or it may be that they inhibit (i.e. reduce) the behavior of drinking.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Second, there are doubts about the long-term effectiveness of aversion therapy.  It can have dramatic effects in the therapist’s office. However, it is often much less effective in the outside world, where no nausea-inducing drug has been taken and it is obvious that no shocks will be given.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Also, relapse rates are very high – the success of the therapy depends of whether the patient can avoid the stimulus they have been conditioned against.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Flooding</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Flooding (also known as implosion therapy) works by exposing the patient directly to their worst fears. (S)he is thrown in at the deep end. For example, a claustrophobic will be locked in a closet for 4 hours or an individual with a fear of flying will be sent up in a light aircraft.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">What flooding aims to do is expose the sufferer to the phobic object or situation for an extended period of time in a safe and controlled environment. Unlike systematic desensitisation which might use in vitro or virtual exposure, flooding generally involves vivo exposure.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Fear is a time limited response. At first the person is in a state of extreme anxiety, perhaps even panic, but eventually exhaustion sets in and the anxiety level begins to go down.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Of course, normally the person would do everything they can to avoid such a situation. Now they have no choice but confront their fears and when the panic subsides and they find they have come to no harm. The fear (which to a large degree was anticipatory) is extinguished.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Prolonged intense exposure eventually creates a new association between the feared object and something positive (e.g. a sense of calm and lack of anxiety). It also prevents reinforcement of phobia through escape or avoidance behaviors.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Critical Evaluation</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Flooding is rarely used and if you are not careful it can be dangerous. It is not an appropriate treatment for every phobia. It should be used with caution as some people can actually increase their fear after therapy, and it is not possible to predict when this will occur.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Wolpe (1969) reported the case of a client whose anxiety intensified to such as degree that flooding therapy resulted in her being hospitalized.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Also, some people will not be able to tolerate the high levels of anxiety induced by the therapy, and are therefore at risk of exiting the therapy before they are calm and relaxed. This is a problem, as existing treatment before completion is likely to strengthen rather than weaken the phobia.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">However one application is with people who have a fear of water (they are forced to swim out of their depth). It is also sometimes used with agoraphobia. In general flooding produces results as effective (sometimes even more so) as systematic desensitisation.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The success of the method confirms the hypothesis that phobias are so persistent because the object is avoided in real life and is therefore not extinguished by the discovery that it is harmless.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For example, Wolpe (1960) forced an adolescent girl with a fear of cars into the back of a car and drove her around continuously for four hours: her fear reached hysterical heights but then receded and, by the end of the journey, had completely disappeared.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Systematic Desensitization</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/Systematic-Desensitisation.html">Systematic desensitization i</a>s a type of behavioral therapy based on the principle of classical conditioning. It was developed by Wolpe during the 1950s. This therapy aims to remove the fear response of a phobia, and substitute a relaxation response to the conditional stimulus gradually using counter conditioning. There are three phases to the treatment:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">First, the patient is taught a deep muscle relaxation technique and breathing exercises. E.g. control over breathing, muscle detensioning or meditation. This step is very important because of reciprocal inhibition, where once response is inhibited because it is incompatible with another. In the case of phobias, fears involves tension and tension is incompatible with relaxation.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Second, the patient creates a fear hierarchy starting at stimuli that create the least anxiety (fear) and building up in stages to the most fear provoking images. The list is crucial as it provides a structure for the therapy.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Third, the patient works their way up the fear hierarchy, starting at the least unpleasant stimuli and practising their relaxation technique as they go. When they feel comfortable with this (they are no longer afraid) they move on to the next stage in the hierarchy. If the client becomes upset they can return to an earlier stage and regain their relaxed state.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The client repeatedly imagines (or is confronted by) this situation until it fails to evoke any anxiety at all, indicating that the therapy has been successful. This process is repeated while working through all of the situations in the anxiety hierarchy until the most anxiety-provoking.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Operant Conditioning</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Operant conditioning is a method of learning that occurs through rewards and punishments for behavior. Through operant conditioning, an individual makes an association between a particular behavior and a consequence (Skinner, 1938). Examples of therapies using the principles of operant conditioning include:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Token Economy</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Token economy  is a system in which targeted behaviors are reinforced with tokens (secondary reinforcers) and later exchanged for rewards (primary reinforcers).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Tokens can be in the form of fake money, buttons, poker chips, stickers, etc. While the rewards can range anywhere from snacks to privileges or activities. For example, teachers use token economy  at primary school by giving young children stickers to reward good behavior.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Bandura &#8211; Social Learning Theory</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">WAHEED ALOMARI</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In social learning theory, Albert Bandura (1977) agrees with the behaviorist learning</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">theories of <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/classical-conditioning.html">classical conditioning a</a>nd <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/operant-conditioning.html">operant conditioning.</a> However, he adds two important ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;"> Mediating processes occur between stimuli &amp; responses.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;"> Behavior is learned from the environment through the process of observational learning.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;">Observational Learning</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Children observe the people around them behaving in various ways. This is illustrated during the famous <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/bobo-doll.html">Bobo doll experiment</a> (Bandura, 1961).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Individuals that are observed are called models. In society, children are surrounded by many influential models, such as parents within the family, characters on children’s TV, friends within their peer group and teachers at school. These models provide examples of behavior to observe and imitate, e.g., masculine and feminine, pro and anti-social, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Children pay attention to some of these people (models) and <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/memory.html">encode t</a>heir behavior. At a later time they may imitate (i.e., copy) the behavior they have observed. They may do this regardless of whether the behavior is ‘gender appropriate’ or not, but there are a number of processes that make it more likely that a child will reproduce the behavior that its society deems appropriate for its gender.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">First, the child is more likely to attend to and imitate those people it perceives as similar to itself. Consequently, it is more likely to imitate behavior modeled by people of the same gender.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Second, the people around the child will respond to the behavior it imitates with either reinforcement or punishment. If a child imitates a model’s behavior and the consequences are rewarding, the child is likely to continue performing the behavior. If a parent sees a little girl consoling her teddy bear and says “what a kind girl you are,” this is rewarding for</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">the child and makes it more likely that she will repeat the behavior. Her behavior has been reinforced (i.e., strengthened).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Reinforcement can be external or internal and can be positive or negative. If a child wants approval from parents or peers, this approval is an external reinforcement, but feeling happy about being approved of is an internal reinforcement. A child will behave in a way which it believes will earn approval because it desires approval.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Positive (or negative) reinforcement will have little impact if the reinforcement offered<a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/operant-conditioning.html"> externally does not match with an individual&#8217;s needs. Reinforcement can be positive or</a> <u>negative</u>, but the important factor is that it will usually lead to a change in a person&#8217;s behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Third, the child will also take into account of what happens to other people when deciding whether or not to copy someone’s actions. A person learns by observing the consequences of another person’s (i.e., models) behavior, e.g., a younger sister observing an older sister being rewarded for a particular behavior is more likely to repeat that behavior herself. This is known as vicarious reinforcement.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This relates to an attachment to specific models that possess qualities seen as rewarding. Children will have a number of models with whom they identify. These may be people in their immediate world, such as parents or older siblings, or could be fantasy characters or people in the media. The motivation to identify with a particular model is that they have a quality which the individual would like to possess.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Identification occurs with another person (the model) and involves taking on (or adopting) observed behaviors, values, beliefs and attitudes of the person with whom you are identifying.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The term identification as used by Social Learning Theory is similar to the Freudian term related to the Oedipus complex. For example, they both involve internalizing or adopting another person’s behavior. However, during the Oedipus complex, the child can only identify with the same sex parent, whereas with Social Learning Theory the person (child or adult) can potentially identify with any other person.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Identification is different to imitation as it may involve a number of behaviors being adopted, whereas imitation usually involves copying a single behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Mediational Processes</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">SLT is often described as the ‘bridge’ between traditional learning theory (i.e., <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/behaviorism.html">behaviorism)</a> and the cognitive approach. This is because it focuses on how mental (cognitive) factors are involved in learning.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Unlike <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/operant-conditioning.html">Skinner</a>, Bandura (1977) believes that humans are active <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/information-processing.html">information processors</a> and think about the relationship between their behavior and its consequences. Observational learning could not occur unless cognitive processes were at work. These mental factors mediate (i.e., intervene) in the learning process to determine whether a new response is acquired.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Therefore, individuals do not automatically observe the behavior of a model and imitate it. There is some thought prior to imitation, and this consideration is called mediational processes. This occurs between observing the behavior (stimulus) and imitating it or not (response)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There are four mediational processes proposed by Bandura:</p>
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="2">
<li>1. <strong>Attention</strong>: The extent to which we are exposed/notice the behavior. For a behavior to be imitated, it has to grab our attention. We observe many behaviors on a daily basis, and many of these are not noteworthy. Attention is therefore extremely important in whether a behavior influences others imitating</li>
<li>2. <strong>Retention</strong>: How well the behavior is remembered. The behavior may be noticed but is it not always remembered which obviously prevents imitation. It is important therefore that a memory of the behavior is formed to be performed later by the observer.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:left;">Much of social learning is not immediate, so this process is especially vital in those cases. Even if the behavior is reproduced shortly after seeing it, there needs to be a memory to refer to.</p>
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="3">
<li>3. <strong>Reproduction</strong>: This is the ability to perform the behavior that the model has just demonstrated. We see much behavior on a daily basis that we would like to be able to imitate but that this not always possible. We are limited by our physical ability and for that reason, even if we wish to reproduce the behavior, we canno</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:left;">This influences our decisions whether to try and imitate it or not. Imagine the scenario of a 90-year-old-lady who struggles to walk watching Dancing on Ice. She may appreciate that the skill is a desirable one, but she will not attempt to imitate it because she physically cannot do it.</p>
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="4">
<li>4. <strong>Motivation</strong>: The will to perform the behavior. The rewards and punishment that</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:left;">follow a behavior will be considered by the observer. If the perceived rewards outweigh the perceived costs (if there are any), then the behavior will be more likely to be imitated by the observer. If the vicarious reinforcement is not seen to be important enough to the observer, then they will not imitate the behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Critical Evaluation</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The social learning approach takes thought processes into account and acknowledges the role that they play in deciding if a behavior is to be imitated or not. As such, SLT provides a more comprehensive explanation of human learning by recognizing the role of mediational processes.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">However, although it can explain some quite complex behavior, it cannot adequately account for how we develop a whole range of behavior including thoughts and feelings. We have a lot of cognitive control over our behavior and just because we have had experiences of violence does not mean we have to reproduce such behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It is for this reason that Bandura modified his theory and in 1986 renamed his Social Learning Theory, Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), as a better description of how we learn from our social experiences.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Some criticisms of social learning theory arise from their commitment to the environment as the chief influence on behavior. It is limiting to describe behavior solely in terms of either nature or nurture and attempts to do this underestimate the complexity of human behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It is more likely that behavior is due to an interaction between nature (biology) and nurture</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(environment).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Social learning theory is not a full explanation for all behavior. This is particularly the case when there is no apparent role model in the person’s life to imitate for a given behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The discovery of mirror neurons has lent biological support to the theory of social learning. Although research is in its infancy the recent discovery of &#8220;mirror neurons&#8221; in primates may constitute a neurological basis for imitation. These are neurons which fire both if the animal does something itself, and if it observes the action being done by another.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Edward Thorndike: The Law of Effect</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">WAHEED ALOMARI</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The law of effect principle developed by Edward Thorndike suggested that:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;responses that produce a satisfying effect in a particular situation become more likely to occur again in that situation, and responses that produce a discomforting effect become less likely to occur again in that situation (Gray, 2011, pp 108–109).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Edward Thorndike (1898) is famous in psychology for his work on learning theory that lead to the development of <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/operant-conditioning.html">operant    co nditioning w</a>ithin <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/behaviorism.html">behaviorism.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Whereas classical conditioning depends on developing associations between events, operant conditioning involves learning from the consequences of our behavior.  Skinner wasn’t the first psychologist to study learning by consequences. Indeed, Skinner&#8217;s theory of operant conditioning is built on the ideas of Edward Thorndike.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Thorndike studied learning in animals (usually cats).  He devised a classic experiment in which he used a puzzle  box (see fig. 1) to empirically test the laws of learning.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>F</strong><strong>ig 1</strong>: Simplified graph of the result of the puzzle  box experiment.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">He placed a cat in the puzzle  box, which was encourage to escape to reach a scrap of fish placed outside. Thorndike would put a cat into the box and time how long it took to</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">escape. The cats experimented with different ways to escape the puzzle  box and reach the fish.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Eventually they would stumble upon the lever which opened the cage. When it had escaped it was put in again, and once more the time it took to escape was noted.  In successive trials the cats would learn that pressing the lever would have favorable consequences and they would adopt this behavior, becoming increasingly quick at pressing the lever.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Edward Thorndike put forward a “ <strong>Law of effect</strong>” which stated that any behavior that is followed by pleasant consequences is likely to be repeated, and any behavior followed by</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">unpleasant consequences is likely to be stopped.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Critical Evaluation</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Thorndike (1905) introduced the concept  of reinforcement and was the first to apply psychological principles to the area of learning.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">His research led to many theories and laws of learning, such as operant conditioning. Skinner (1938), like Thorndike, put animals in boxes and observed them to see what they were able to learn.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The learning theories of Thorndike and Pavlov were later synthesized by Hull (1935). Thorndike&#8217;s research drove <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/comparative-psychology.html">comparative </a><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/comparative-psychology.html">psychology f</a>or fifty years, and influenced countless psychologists over that period of time, and even still today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Operant Conditioning</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">WAHEED ALOMARI</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Operant conditioning is a method of learning that occurs through rewards and punishments for behaviour. Through operant conditioning, an individual makes an association between a particular behaviour and a consequence (Skinner, 1938).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">By the 1920s, John B. Watson had left academic psychology, and other <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/behaviorism.html">behaviourists were</a> becoming influential, proposing new forms of learning other than <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/classical-conditioning.html">classical conditioning.</a> Perhaps the most important of these was Burrhus Frederic Skinner. Although, for obvious reasons, he is more commonly known as B.F. Skinner.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Skinner&#8217;s views were slightly less extreme than those of <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/classical-conditioning.html">Watson (1913).</a> Skinner believed that we do have such a thing as a mind, but that it is simply more productive to study observable behaviour rather than internal mental events.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The work of Skinner was rooted in a view that classical conditioning was far too simplistic to be a complete explanation of complex human behaviour. He believed that the best way to understand behaviour is to look at the causes of an action and its consequences. He called this approach operant conditioning.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><u>BF Skinner</u>: Operant Conditioning</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Skinner is regarded as the father of Operant Conditioning, but his work was based on <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/edward-thorndike.html">Thorndike’s (1898) law of effect.</a> According to this principle, behaviour that is followed by pleasant consequences is likely to be repeated, and behaviour followed by unpleasant consequences is less likely to be repeated.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Skinner introduced a new term into the Law of Effect &#8211; Reinforcement. Behaviour which is reinforced tends to be repeated (i.e., strengthened); behaviour which is not reinforced tends to die out-or be extinguished (i.e., weakened).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Skinner (1948) studied operant conditioning by conducting experiments using animals</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">which he placed in a &#8216;<em>Skinner Box</em>&#8216; which was similar to Thorndike’s puzzle box.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Skinner identified three types of responses, or operant, that can follow behaviour.</p>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li><strong>Neutral operants</strong>: responses from the environment that neither increase nor decrease the probability of a behaviour being repeated.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li><strong>Reinforcers</strong>: Responses from the environment that increase the probability of a behaviour being repeated. Reinforcers can be either positive or negative.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li><strong>Punishers</strong>: Responses from the environment that decrease the likelihood of a behaviour being repeated. Punishment weakens behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;">We can all think of examples of how our own behaviour has been affected by reinforcers and punishers. As a child you probably tried out a number of behaviours and learned from their consequences.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For example, if when you were younger you tried smoking at school, and the chief consequence was that you got in with the crowd you always wanted to hang out with, you would have been positively reinforced (i.e., rewarded) and would be likely to repeat the behaviour.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">If, however, the main consequence was that you were caught, caned, suspended from school and your parents became involved you would most certainly have been punished, and you would consequently be much less likely to smoke now.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Positive Reinforcement</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Skinner showed how positive reinforcement worked by placing a hungry rat in his Skinner box. The box contained a lever on the side, and as the rat moved about the box, it would accidentally knock the lever. Immediately it did so a food pellet would drop into a container next to the lever.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The rats quickly learned to go straight to the lever after a few times of being put in the box. The consequence of receiving food if they pressed the lever ensured that they would repeat the action again and again.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Positive reinforcement strengthens a behaviour by providing a consequence an individual finds rewarding. For example, if your teacher gives you £5 each time you complete your homework (i.e., a reward) you will be more likely to repeat this behaviour in the future, thus strengthening the behaviour of completing your homework.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Negative Reinforcement</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The removal of an unpleasant reinforcer can also strengthen behaviour. This is known as negative reinforcement because it is the removal of an adverse stimulus which is ‘rewarding’ to the animal or person. Negative reinforcement strengthens behaviour because it stops or removes an unpleasant experience.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For example, if you do not complete your homework, you give your teacher £5. You will complete your homework to avoid paying £5, thus strengthening the behaviour of completing your homework.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Skinner showed how negative reinforcement worked by placing a rat in his Skinner box and then subjecting it to an unpleasant electric current which caused it some discomfort. As the rat moved about the box it would accidentally knock the lever. Immediately it did so the electric current would be switched off. The rats quickly learned to go straight to the lever after a few times of being put in the box. The consequence of escaping the electric current ensured that they would repeat the action again and again.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In fact Skinner even taught the rats to avoid the electric current by turning on a light just before the electric current came on. The rats soon learned to press the lever when the light came on because they knew that this would stop the electric current being switched on.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">These two learned responses are known as <em>Escape Learning </em>and <em>Avoidance Learning</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Punishment (weakens behaviour)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Punishment is defined as the opposite of reinforcement since it is designed to weaken or eliminate a response rather than increase it. It is an aversive event that decreases the behaviour that it follows.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Like reinforcement, punishment can work either by directly applying an unpleasant stimulus like a shock after a response or by removing a potentially rewarding stimulus, for instance, deducting someone’s pocket money to punish undesirable behaviour.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Note: It is not always easy to distinguish between punishment and negative reinforcement.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There are many problems with using punishment, such as:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Punished behaviour is not forgotten, it&#8217;s suppressed &#8211; behaviour returns when</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">punishment is no longer present.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Causes increased aggression &#8211; shows that aggression is a way to cope with problems.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Creates fear that can generalize to undesirable behaviours, e.g., fear of school.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Does not necessarily guide toward desired behaviour &#8211; reinforcement tells you what to do, punishment only tells you what not to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Schedules of Reinforcement</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imagine a rat in a “Skinner box.” In operant conditioning, if no food pellet is delivered immediately after the lever is pressed then after several attempts the rat stops pressing the lever (how long would someone continue to go to work if their employer stopped paying them?). The behaviour has been extinguished.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Behaviourists discovered that different patterns <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1284863/pdf/12083682.pdf">(or schedules) of reinforcement had</a> different effects on the speed of learning and extinction. Ferster and Skinner (1957) devised different ways of delivering reinforcement and found that this had effects on</p>
<ol style="text-align:left;">
<li><strong>The Response Rate </strong>&#8211; The rate at which the rat pressed the lever (i.e., how hard the rat worked).</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align:left;" start="2">
<li><strong>The Extinction Rate </strong>&#8211; The rate at which lever pressing dies out (i.e., how soon the rat gave up).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:left;">Skinner found that the type of reinforcement which produces the slowest rate of extinction (i.e., people will go on repeating the behaviour for the longest time without reinforcement) is variable-ratio reinforcement. The type of reinforcement which has the quickest rate of extinction is continuous reinforcement.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(A) Continuous Reinforcement</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">An animal/human is positively reinforced every time a specific behaviour occurs, e.g., every time a lever is pressed a pellet is delivered, and then food delivery is shut off.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Response rate is SLOW</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Extinction rate is FAST</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(B) Fixed Ratio Reinforcement</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Behaviour is reinforced only after the behaviour occurs a specified number of times. e.g., one reinforcement is given after every so many correct responses, e.g., after every 5th response.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For example, a child receives a star for every five words spelled correctly.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Response rate is FAST</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Extinction rate is MEDIUM</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(C) Fixed Interval Reinforcement</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">One reinforcement is given after a fixed time interval providing at least one correct response has been made. An example is being paid by the hour. Another example would be every 15 minutes (half hour, hour, etc.) a pellet is delivered (providing at least one lever press has been made) then food delivery is shut off.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Response rate is MEDIUM</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Extinction rate is MEDIUM</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(D) Variable Ratio Reinforcement</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Behaviour is reinforced after an unpredictable number of times. For examples gambling or fishing.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Response rate is FAST</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Extinction rate is SLOW (very hard to extinguish because of unpredictability)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(E) Variable Interval Reinforcement</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Providing one correct response has been made, reinforcement is given after an unpredictable amount of time has passed, e.g., on average every 5 minutes. An example is a self-employed person being paid at unpredictable times.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Response rate is FAST</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Extinction rate is SLOW</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Behaviour Modification</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Behaviour modification is a set of therapies / techniques based on operant conditioning (Skinner, 1938, 1953). The main principle comprises changing environmental events that are related to a person&#8217;s behaviour. For example, the reinforcement of desired behaviours and ignoring or punishing undesired ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This is not as simple as it sounds — always reinforcing desired behaviour, for example, is basically bribery.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There are different types of positive reinforcements. Primary reinforcement is when a reward strengths a behaviour by itself. Secondary reinforcement is when something strengthens a behaviour because it leads to a primary reinforcer.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Examples of behaviour modification therapy include token economy and behaviour shaping.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Token Economy</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Token economy is a system in which targeted behaviours are reinforced with tokens</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(secondary reinforcers) and later exchanged for rewards (primary reinforcers).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Tokens can be in the form of fake money, buttons, poker chips, stickers, etc. While the rewards can range anywhere from snacks to privileges or activities. For example, teachers use token economy at primary school by giving young children stickers to reward good behaviour.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Token economy has been found to be very effective in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1403907/pdf/jeabehav00203-0061.pdf">managing psychiatric patients.</a> However, the patients can become over reliant on the tokens, making it difficult for them to adjust to society once they leave prison, hospital, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Staff implementing a token economy programme have a lot of power. It is important that staff do not favor or ignore certain individuals if the programme is to work. Therefore, staff need to be trained to give tokens fairly and consistently even when there are shift changes such as in prisons or in a psychiatric hospital.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Behaviour Shaping</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A further important contribution made by Skinner (1951) is the notion of behaviour shaping through successive approximation. Skinner argues that the principles of operant conditioning can be used to produce extremely complex behaviour if rewards and punishments are delivered in such a way as to encourage move an organism closer and closer to the desired behaviour each time.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">To do this, the conditions (or contingencies) required to receive the reward should shift each time the organism moves a step closer to the desired behaviour.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">According to Skinner, most animal and human behaviour (including language) can be</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">explained as a product of this type of successive approximation.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Educational Applications</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In the conventional learning situation, operant conditioning applies largely to issues of class and student management, rather than to learning content. It is very relevant to shaping skill performance.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A simple way to shape behaviour is to provide feedback on learner performance, e.g., compliments, approval, encouragement, and affirmation. A variable-ratio produces the highest response rate for students learning a new task, whereby initially reinforcement (e.g., praise) occurs at frequent intervals, and as the performance improves reinforcement occurs less frequently, until eventually only exceptional outcomes are reinforced.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For example, if a teacher wanted to encourage students to answer questions in class they should praise them for every attempt (regardless of whether their answer is correct). Gradually the teacher will only praise the students when their answer is correct, and over time only exceptional answers will be praised.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Unwanted behaviours, such as tardiness and dominating class discussion can be extinguished through being ignored by the teacher (rather than being reinforced by having attention drawn to them). This is not an easy task, as the teacher may appear insincere if he/she thinks too much about the way to behave.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Knowledge of success is also important as it motivates future learning. However, it is important to vary the type of reinforcement given so that the behaviour is maintained. This is not an easy task, as the teacher may appear insincere if he/she thinks too much about the way to behave.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Summary</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Looking at Skinner&#8217;s classic studies on pigeons’ / rat&#8217;s behaviour we can identify some of the major assumptions of the <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/behaviorism">behaviourist approach.</a></p>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/science-psychology.html">Psychology should be seen as a science,</a> to be studied in a scientific manner. Skinner&#8217;s study of behaviour in rats was conducted under carefully controlled <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/experimental-method.html#lab">laboratory conditions.</a></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li>Behaviorism is primarily concerned with observable behaviour, as opposed to</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;">internal events like thinking and emotion. Note that Skinner did not say that the rats learned to press a lever because they wanted food. He instead concentrated on describing the easily observed behaviour that the rats acquired.</p>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li>The major influence on human behaviour is learning from our environment. In the Skinner study, because food followed a particular behaviour the rats learned to repeat that behaviour, e.g., operant conditioning.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li>There is little difference between the learning that takes place in humans and that in other animals. Therefore research (e.g., operant conditioning) can be carried out on animals (Rats / Pigeons) as well as on humans. Skinner proposed that the way humans learn behaviour is much the same as the way the rats learned to press a lever.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;">So, if your layperson&#8217;s idea of psychology has always been of people in laboratories wearing white coats and watching hapless rats try to negotiate mazes in order to get to their dinner, then you are probably thinking of behavioural psychology.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/behaviorism.html">Behaviorism and</a> its offshoots tend to be among the most scientific of the psychological perspectives. The emphasis of behavioural psychology is on how we learn to behave in certain ways.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">We are all constantly learning new behaviours and how to modify our existing behaviour. Behavioural psychology is the psychological approach that focuses on how this learning takes place.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Critical Evaluation</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Operant conditioning can be used to explain a wide variety of behaviours, from the process of learning, to addiction and <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/language.html">language acquisition.</a> It also has practical application (such as token economy) which can be applied in classrooms, prisons and psychiatric hospitals.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">However, operant conditioning fails to take into account the role of inherited and <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive.html">cognitive</a><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive.html"> factors in</a> learning, and thus is an incomplete explanation of the learning process in humans and animals.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For example, Kohler (1924) found that primates often seem to solve problems in a flash of insight rather than be trial and error learning. Also, social learning theory (Bandura, 1977) suggests that humans can learn automatically through observation rather than through personal experience.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The use of animal research in operant conditioning studies also raises the issue of extrapolation. Some psychologists argue we cannot generalize from studies on animals to humans as their anatomy and physiology is different from humans, and they cannot think about their experiences and invoke reason, patience, memory or self-comfort.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Key Terms</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Operant Conditioning</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Operant conditioning involves learning through the consequences of behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Positive Reinforcement</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Presenting the subject with something that it likes. e.g., Skinner rewarded his rats with food pellets.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Negative Reinforcement</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Reward – in the sense of removing or avoiding some aversive (painful) stimulus. E.g., Skinner&#8217;s rats learned to press the lever in order to switch off the electric current in the cage.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Punishment</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imposing an aversive or painful stimulus. e.g., Skinner’s rats were given electric shocks.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Primary Reinforcers</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">These are stimuli which are naturally reinforcing because they directly satisfy a need. E.g., food, water.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">These are stimuli, which are reinforcing through their association with a primary reinforcer. i.e., they do not directly satisfy a need but may be the means to do so. E.g., Money! You cannot eat it or drink it, but if you have it, you can buy whatever you want. So a secondary reinforcer can be just as powerful a motivator as a primary reinforcer.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Shaping</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In shaping, the form of an existing response is gradually changed across successive trials towards a desired target behaviour by rewarding exact segments of behaviour.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Everything from speech to emotional responses was simply patterns of stimulus and</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">response. Watson denied completely the existence of the mind or consciousness. Watson</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">believed that all individual differences in behavior were due to different experiences of</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">learning. He famously said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;Give me a dozen healthy infants, well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">in and I&#8217;ll guarantee to take anyone at random and train him to become any type of specialist I</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">might select &#8211; doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief and, yes, even beggar-man and thief,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations and the race of his</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">ancestors” (Watson, 1924, p. 104).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Classical Conditioning Examples</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Classical conditioning theory involves learning a new behavior via the process of</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">association. In simple terms, two stimuli are linked together to produce a new learned</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">response in a person or animal. There are three stages of classical conditioning. At each</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">stage the stimuli and responses are given special scientific terms:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Stage 1: Before Conditioning</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In this stage, the unconditioned stimulus (UCS) produces an unconditioned response</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(UCR) in an organism. In basic terms, this means that a stimulus in the environment has</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">produced a behavior/response which is unlearned (i.e., unconditioned) and therefore is a</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">natural response that has not been taught. In this respect, no new behavior has been</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">learned yet.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For example, a stomach virus (UCS) would produce a response of nausea (UCR). In</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">another example, a perfume (UCS) could create a response of happiness or desire (UCR)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This stage also involves another stimulus which has no effect on a person and is called the</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">neutral stimulus (NS). The NS could be a person, object, place, etc. The neutral stimulus</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">in classical conditioning does not produce a response until it is paired with the</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">unconditioned stimulus.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Stage 2: During Conditioning</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">During this stage, a stimulus which produces no response (i.e., neutral) is associated with</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">the unconditioned stimulus at which point it now becomes known as the conditioned</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">stimulus (CS).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For example, a stomach virus (UCS) might be associated with eating certain food such</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">as chocolate (CS). Also, perfume (UCS) might be associated with a specific person (CS).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Often during this stage, the UCS must be associated with the CS on several</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">occasions, or trials, for learning to take place. However, one trail learning can happen on</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">certain occasions when an association doesn&#8217;t need to be strengthened over time</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(such as being sick after food poisoning or drinking too much alcohol).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Stage 3: After Conditioning</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Now the conditioned stimulus (CS) has been associated with the unconditioned stimulus</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(UCS) to create a new conditioned response (CR).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For example, a person (CS) who has been associated with nice perfume (UCS) is now</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">found attractive (CR). Also, chocolate (CS) which was eaten before a person was sick with</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">a virus (UCS) now produces a response of nausea (CR).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">showed no fear of any of these stimuli. However, what did startle him and cause him to be</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">afraid as if a hammer was struck against a steel bar behind his head. The sudden loud</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">noise would cause &#8220;little Albert to burst into tears.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">When Little Albert was just over 11 months old, the white rat was presented, and seconds</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">later the hammer was struck against the steel bar.  This was done seven times over the</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">next seven weeks, and each time Little Albert burst into tears. By now little Albert only had</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">to see the rat and he immediately showed every sign of fear. He would cry (whether or not</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">the hammer was hit against the steel bar) and he would attempt to crawl away.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Also, Watson and Rayner found that Albert developed phobias of objects which</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">shared characteristics with the rat; including the family dog, a fur coat, some cotton wool</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">and a Father Christmas mask! This process is known as generalization.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Watson and Rayner had shown that classical conditioning could be used to create a</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">phobia. A phobia is an irrational fear, i.e., a fear that is out of proportion to the danger. Over</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">the next few weeks and months, Little Albert was observed and ten days after conditioning</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">his fear of the rat was much less marked. This dying out of a learned response is called</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">extinction. However, even after a full month it was still evident, and the association could be</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">renewed by repeating the original procedure a few times.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Classical Conditioning in the Classroom</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The implications of classical conditioning in the classroom are less important than those of</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">operant conditioning, but there is a still need for teachers to try to make sure that students</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">associate positive emotional experiences with learning.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">If a student associates negative emotional experiences with school, then this can obviously</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">have bad results, such as creating a school phobia.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For example, if a student is bullied at school, they may learn to associate the school with</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">fear. It could also explain why some students show a particular dislike of certain subjects</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">that continue throughout their academic careers. This could happen if a student is humiliated</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">or punished in class by a teacher.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Critical Evaluation</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Classical conditioning emphasizes the importance of learning from the environment, and</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">supports nurture over nature. However, it is limiting to describe behavior solely in terms of</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">either nature or nurture, and attempts to do this underestimate the complexity of human</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">behavior. It is more likely that behavior is due to an interaction between nature (biology)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">and nurture (environment).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A strength of classical conditioning theory is that it is scientific. This is because it&#8217;s based</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">on empirical evidence carried out by controlled experiments. For example, Pavlov (1902)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">showed how classical conditioning could be used to make a dog salivate to the sound of a</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">bell.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Classical conditioning is also a reductionist explanation of behavior. This is because a</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">complex behavior is broken down into smaller stimulus-response units of behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Supporters of a reductionist approach say that it is scientific. Breaking complicated</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">behaviors down to small parts means that they can be scientifically tested. However, so would argue that the reductionist view lacks validity. Thus, while reductionism is useful, it</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">can lead to incomplete explanations.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A final criticism of classical conditioning theory is that it is deterministic. This means that ideas do not allow for any degree of free will in the individual. Accordingly, a person has no</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">control over the reactions they have learned from classical conditioning, such as a phobia</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The deterministic approach also has important implications for psychology as a science.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Scientists are interested in discovering laws that can then be used to predict events.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">However, by creating general laws of behavior, deterministic psychology underestimates</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">the uniqueness of human beings and their freedom to choose their own destiny.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Behaviorism refers to a psychological approach that emphasizes scientific and objective</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">methods of investigation. The approach is only concerned with observable stimulus-response behaviors, and states all behaviors are learned through interaction with the</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">environment.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The behaviorist movement began in 1913 when John Watson wrote an article entitled</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">‘Psychology as the behaviorist views it,’ which set out a number of underlying assumptions</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">regarding methodology and behavioral analysis:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Basic Assumptions</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">All behavior is learned from the environment:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Behaviorism emphasizes the role of environmental factors in influencing behavior,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> to the near exclusion of innate or inherited factors. This amounts essentially to a focus on</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">learning.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">We learn new behavior through classical or operant conditioning (collectively known as</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">‘learning theory’).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Psychology should be seen as a science:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Theories need to be supported by empirical data obtained through careful and controlled</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">observation and measurement of behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Watson (1913) stated that:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">‘Psychology as a behaviorist views it is a purely objective experimental branch of natural</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">science. Its theoretical goal is … prediction and control.’ (p. 158).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The components of a theory should be as simple as possible. Behaviorists propose the use</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">of operational definitions (defining variables in terms of observable, measurable events).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Behaviorism is primarily concerned with observable behavior, as opposed to</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">internal events like thinking and emotion:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">While behaviorists often accept the existence of cognition and emotions, they prefer not to</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">study them as only observable (i.e., external) behavior can be objectively and scientifically</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">measured.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Therefore, internal events, such as thinking should be explained through behavioral terms</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(or eliminated altogether).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There is little difference between the learning that takes place in humans and that in other animals:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There’s no fundamental (qualitative) distinction between human and animal behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Therefore, research can be carried out on animals as well as humans</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> (i.e., comparative psychology)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Consequently, rats and pigeons became the primary source of data for behaviorists, as</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">their environments could be easily controlled.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Behavior is the result of stimulus-response:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">All behavior, no matter how complex, can be reduced to a simple stimulus-response</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">association). Watson described the purpose of psychology as:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">‘To predict, given the stimulus, what reaction will take place; or, given the reaction, state</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">what the situation or stimulus is that has caused the reaction.’ (1930, p. 11).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Types of Behaviorism</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Historically, the most significant distinction between versions of behaviorism is that</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">between Watson’s original ‘methodological behaviorism,’ and forms of behaviorism later</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">inspired by his work, known collectively as NE behaviorism (e.g., radical behaviorism).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Methodological Behaviorism</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Watson’s article ‘Psychology as the behaviorist views it’ is often referred to as the</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">‘behaviorist manifesto,’ in which Watson (1913, p. 158) outlines the principles of all</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">behaviorists:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">‘Psychology as the behaviorist views it is a purely objective experimental branch of natural</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">science. Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. Introspection forms no</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The behaviorist, in his efforts to get a unitary scheme of animal response, recognizes no</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">dividing line between man and brute. The behavior of man, with all of its refinement and</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">complexity, forms only a part of the behaviorist’s total scheme of investigation’.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Radical Behaviorism</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Radical behaviorism was founded by B.F Skinner and agreed with the assumption of</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">methodological behaviorism that the goal of psychology should be to predict and control</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Skinner, like Watson, also recognized the role of internal mental events, and while he</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">agreed such private events could not be used to explain behavior, he proposed they should</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">be explained in the analysis of behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Another important distinction between methodological and radical behaviorism concerns</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">the extent to which environmental factors influence behavior. Watson’s (1913)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">methodological behaviorism asserts the mind is a tabula rasa (a blank slate) at birth. In</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">contrast, radical behaviorism accepts the view that organisms are born with innate</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">behaviors, and thus recognizes the role of genes and biological components in behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The History of Behaviorism</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Pavlov (1897) published the results of an experiment on conditioning after originally</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">studying digestion in dogs.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Watson (1913) launches the behavioral school of psychology, publishing an article,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Psychology as the behaviorist views it.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Watson and Rayner (1920) conditioned an orphan called Albert B (aka Little Albert) to</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">fear a white rat</p>
